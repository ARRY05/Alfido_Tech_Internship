🚀 Alfido Tech Internship Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio for the task/project-based internship at Alfido Tech!  
This repository contains all three major projects I completed during my data analytics internship, showcasing a range of real-world analytics—from customer behavior to website traffic and retail sales.

📝 About the Internship

During my time at **Alfido Tech**, I worked on several diverse data analysis challenges to sharpen my technical and business insight skills. Each project involved hands-on problem-solving with authentic datasets, using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

📂 What's Inside This Repo?

- Task 1: Customer Behavior Analysis
  - Explored and visualized customer purchasing patterns, payment methods, and churn trends in an e-commerce setting.
  - Techniques: Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, actionable visualizations.

- Task 2: Website Traffic Analysis
  - Investigated event logs to uncover trends by date, country, artist, and track.
