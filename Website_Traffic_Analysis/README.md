Website Traffic Analysis

Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of website traffic data, including event volume, top countries, leading artists, popular tracks, and monthly trends. The primary goal is to uncover patterns and actionable insights from user traffic logs, leveraging Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

Features

- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Loads CSV event data, parses dates, handles missing values.
- Descriptive Analytics: Summarizes dataset shape, coverage period, and missing values.
- Time Series Analysis: Visualizes daily and monthly trends in website events.
- Top Categories:
  - Countries with the highest event counts.
  - Most active artists and most played tracks.
- Summary KPIs: Reports aggregate metrics such as unique countries, cities, artists, tracks, and overall event span.
- Customizable Visuals: All charts generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn for publication-ready results.

Repository Structure

- `traffic.csv`: Example CSV file containing website event logs.
- `website_traffic_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook implementing the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

How to Run

1. Clone the repository and place your `traffic.csv` file in the root directory.

2. Install required dependencies:
   
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   

3. Open the notebook (`website_traffic_analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter or Colab.

4. Run cells step by step to upload your data, perform the analysis, and view plots.

Key Analysis Steps

- Upload and Load Data: Import your `traffic.csv` event log into the notebook.
- Clean & Inspect Data: Convert date columns, handle missing values, preview structure, and summarize key metrics.
- Visualize Trends: Generate time series plots and ranked bar charts for the top-performing categories and dimensions.
- KPI Reporting: Review a summary DataFrame of all important traffic statistics.

Example Insights

- Identification of peak activity periods by day and month.
- Countries contributing the most to website events.
- Artists and tracks driving the majority of user engagement.
- Easy-to-read KPIs for reporting and strategic decision-making.

Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for interactive exploration)
